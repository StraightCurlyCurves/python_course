# Python Crash Course

This is the Python Crash Course Repository. It contains practical exercises and examples for learning Python interactively. The content is designed for active participation during the course, rather than passive learning.

This repository is a supplement to the live course and is not intended to replace it. It provides additional resources and exercises to reinforce the concepts taught during the live sessions.

The live sessions offer the opportunity for questions, immediate feedback, and collective learning. The repository and the live sessions together provide a comprehensive learning experience in Python.

If there is a `block_description.md` in a certain folder/block, read that first.
